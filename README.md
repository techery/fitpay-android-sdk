# FitPay Android SDK - README.md

## Building the library

### Building using Android Studio

```
mkdir fitpay  
cd fitpay
git clone git@github.com:fitpay/fitpay-android-sdk.git  
cd fitpay-android-sdk
studio.sh (or double click your android studio)
Open an existing Android Studio project
/home/yourname/fitpay/fitpay-android-sdk
Click on Gradle (topright), select fitpay-android->Tasks->build, build - right click and select "Run fitpay-android[build]"
```

Fit-Pay also utilizes a continuous integration system (travis) to build and test.
Current Develop Branch Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fitpay/fitpay-android-sdk.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/fitpay/fitpay-android-sdk)

### Building from the commandline

Ensure you have the Android SDK installed on your machine. http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

Gradle also automatically runs the tests when you build.

```
export ANDROID_HOME=/home/myname/Android/Sdk
cd ~
mkdir fitpay  
cd fitpay
git clone git@github.com:fitpay/fitpay-android-sdk.git  
cd fitpay-android-sdk  
./gradlew clean build  
```
### Gotchas

#### Use [retrolambda](https://github.com/evant/android-retrolambda-lombok) over the [jack toolchain](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/jackandjill).

If you see an error similar to the following, it's due to the use of the use of the [jack toolchain](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/jackandjill) instead of [retrolambda](https://github.com/evant/android-retrolambda-lombok).

```
com.fitpay.android.api.ApiManager.com_fitpay_android_api_ApiManager_lambda$createUser$0(com.fitpay.android.api.models.user.UserCreateRequest, com.fitpay.android.api.callbacks.ApiCallback)' was expected to be of type direct but instead was found to be of type virtual
```

Add `classpath 'me.tatarka.retrolambda.projectlombok:lombok.ast:0.2.3.a2'` to your dependencies and remove the jack toolchain.

### Running tests using Android Studio

```
Open an existing Android Studio project
/home/yourname/fitpay/fitpay-android-sdk
Click on Gradle (topright), select fitpay-android->Tasks->verification, test - right click and select "Run fitpay-android[test]"
```

### Running tests from the commandline

```
cd fitpay-android-sdk
./gradlew clean test
```

### Problems with the tests?

Some versions of Java come with an encryption distribution that may not be up to modern standards. If you experience problems with SSL connections, please download the [Java Cryptography Extension](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html).

### Running code coverage

You can run code coverage in the android SDK (to highlight individual file results) or manually. To run manually, run:  
gradlew testDebugUnitTestCoverage  
(Filtered) results can be found in fitpay/build/reports/jacoco/testDebugUnitTestCoverage/html. You can also see per line information in fitpay/build/reports/jacoco/testDebugUnitTestCoverage/testDebugUnitTestCoverage.xml.  

## Using a pre-built version of the SDK as a dependency for your build:

Pre-built versions of the Android SDK are hosted on jcenter(). To use in your project:

* make sure jcenter() is listed in the ```repositories``` closure of your application's build.gradle file.

    ```
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            jcenter()
        }
    }
    ```
* add the pre-built SDK dependency, for example to use v0.5.0 of the SDK: ```compile 'com.fitpay.android:android_sdk:0.5.0'``` dependency to the ```dependencies``` closure of the build.gradle file.
    * Grab via Maven:

        ```xml
        <dependency>
        <groupId>com.fitpay.android</groupId>
        <artifactId>android_sdk</artifactId>
        <version>0.5.0</version>
        </dependency>
        ```
    * or Gradle:

        ```groovy
        compile 'com.fitpay.android:android_sdk:0.5.0'
        ```

## Using local version of the SDK as a dependency for your build:
In order to use a local version of the SDK in your project, you need to first build the local repository by using the Gradle task ```uploadArchives``` that's included in the FitPay Android SDK. After running this task, the compiled SDK will be outputted to a local folder on your computer ("LocalRepository") and will be available for use in your project. Note that you may have to clear gradles cached version of the SDK, usually found in $HOME/.gradle/caches/.

You can run the Gradle task and build the repository from Android Studio or from the commandline.

* Build using Android Studio

    ```
    Open the FitPay Android SDK in Android Studio

    /home/yourname/fitpay/fitpay-android-sdk

    Click on Gradle (topright), select fitpay-android->Tasks->upload, uploadArchives - right click and select "Run fitpay-android[uploadArchives]"
    ```

* Build from the commandline
    ```
    Open the FitPay Android SDK in your commandline

    cd fitpay-android-sdk
    ./gradlew clean uploadArchives
    ```

Now that you've built the repository, you need to tell your Android project where it is located and that it needs to be included in your project. Open your Android project, and do the following:

1. Add the local repository's location to the top-level build.gradle file
    ```
    def localMavenRepository = 'file://' + new File(System.getProperty('user.home'), 'LocalRepository').absolutePath
    def String pbwURL = 'http://'
    def String metaDataURL = 'http://artifactory.fpctrl.com:8080/artifactory/repo/fitpay/pagare/maven-metadata.xml'
    ```

2. Include ```localMavenRepository()``` in the ```repositories``` closure of the same top-level build.gradle file.
    ```
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            maven { url localMavenRepository }
        }
    }
     ```
3. Add the repository as a dependency to the module-level build.gradle file of your project.
    ```
    dependencies {
        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        compile 'com.fitpay.android:android_sdk:0.4.20'
    }
    ```

That's it! You are now able to build from your local repository.

## Logging

In order to remain flexible with the various mobile logging strategies, the SDK provides a mechanism to utilize custom logging implementations.  Providing an implementation of the `com.fitpay.android.utils.FPLog$ILog` interface to `com.fitpay.android.utils.FPLog` will allow tailoring logging output from the SDK.

Example implementation using standard Android logging:
```
FPLog.addLogImpl(new FPLog.ILog() {
    @Override
    public void d(String tag, String text) {
        Log.d(tag, text);
    }

    @Override
    public void i(String tag, String text) {
        Log.i(tag, text);
    }

    @Override
    public void w(String tag, String text) {
        Log.w(tag, text);
    }

    @Override
    public void e(String tag, Throwable throwable) {
        Log.e(tag, throwable.getMessage());
    }

    @Override
    public int logLevel() {
        return 0;
    }
});
```

### Logging HTTP Traffic

HTTP traffic originating from the SDK can be logged by calling `FPLog.setShowHTTPLogs(true);`

## Card Scanning

By default the FitPay WebView utilizes a web based card scanning service which is currently being EOL'ed, that means
the ability to scan a card during card entry no must be handled natively by the SDK implementation.  The SDK provides
an interface `IFitPayCardScanner` where a scanning implementation can be provided.   An full working example using the
[Card.IO](https://www.card.io/) utility can be seen in our [reference implementation](https://github.com/fitpay/Pagare_Android_WV/commit/d3d9267154b20e5a6cdb4e6e5c7a9ce5e5d87727).

You will also need to communicate to the webapp that your Android app is capable of handling native card scanning by sending the RealTimeMessaging (RTM) version number of the SDK. An easy way to ensure that the webapp is always aware of this is to send the version when setting the web view client. 

```
webView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {
            @Override
            public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) {
                super.onPageFinished(view, url);
                
                if (webViewCommunicatorImpl != null) {
                    webViewCommunicatorImpl.sendRtmVersion();
                }
            }
        });
```

See an example of this in our [reference implementation](https://github.com/fitpay/Pagare_Android_WV/blob/33f6c41ae920983ab3a01d2221012e74419927d5/app/src/wvUI/java/fitpay.pagare/activities/BaseWvActivity.java#L210).

## Contributing to the SDK
We welcome contributions to the SDK. For your first few contributions please fork the repo, make your changes and submit a pull request. Internally we branch off of develop, test, and PR-review the branch before merging to develop (moderately stable). Releases to Master happen less frequently, undergo more testing, and can be considered stable. For more information, please read:  [http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
